<h3> Introduction</h3> The objective of this assignment is two fold.
<ol>
<li>Solidify the concepts needed to distribute data between PEs corresponding
  to "ghost" or "halo" cells of a 2D stencil computation.  In general, this is
  a tunable parameter, but for this assignment we want you to use the simplest
  halo: width 1.
<li>Develop an intuition for the communication overhead in an MPI program.
</ol>

<p>To achieve this you will perform a series of programming tasks followed by a
series of experimental tasks.  The coding is quite tricky.  I suggest you
follow the steps outlined below.  You will be implementing the communication
required for a 1D data decomposition of Jacobi2D in MPI.  The vast majority of
the code is supplied.  There are comments in the code in the locations<!-- (step-3
of the main function) --> that you need to update.  

<!-- If you are able to get the vertical communication working, but unable to
get the horizontal communication working you copy your file to one named
Jacobi2D-BlockParallel-MPI-VERT.test.c.  We will use this one for automated
testingin the vertical direction if it exists.  <p> -->

The data domain is square (-p problemSize).  Your block may or may not be
square, but each PE only gets a single block.  This means that there is a
mathematical relationship between the problem size, the PE count and the block
sizes (-x xsize -y ysize).  You need to figure that out (and put it in your
report).</p>

<h3> Programming Tasks </h3>
<ol>

  <li> <b> Vertical communication:
[Jacobi2D-BlockParallel-MPI-VERT.test.c]</b> <!--For this part, you are to assume
that xsize=p (and ensure during testing that the command line arguments
reflect this).  Sothe code only does vertical communication-->.  Insert the code
needed to exchange ghost cells between neighbors to the north and south of
each block.  Remember to be cognizant of the order of your sends and receives
as well as making sure you don't attempt to send to a rank that does not exist
(for instance -1).

<li><b> Vertical & Horizontal communication: [Extra-credit]
[Jacobi2D-BlockParallel-MPI.test.c]</b> The given code can handle
both vertical and horizontal communication. Make appropriate changes to accept both horizontal and vertical tile sizes. 
Insert the code needed to exchange ghost cells between neighbors to the east and the west of each block.  Keep in
mind the same gotchas that you ran into for the north and south neighbors.
<!--Also, it may be useful to first test this one with ysize=p, so that the only
communication that occurs is horizontal.-->  <p>

In addition to the above communication step, you will need to write the
code needed to pack/unpack a column of a 2D array as implemented in the code
into a single vector.  There are empty functions (packColToVec and
unpackVecToCol) at the top of the file for you to use for this purpose.  You
will need to call the pack function before MPI_Send, and the unpack function
after MPI_Recv for the east-to-west communication.
</ol>
<h3> Experimental Tasks </h3>
<ol>

  <li> Vertical communication: You should come up with a hypothesis about
  which tile size is going to perform best for this algorithm and test that
  hypothesis. Your hypothesis should be the first section of your report. Run
  your experiments for the following problem size on 1-64 processors of the <b>Cray</b> and report where your code stops scaling. Make sure not to use more than 2 nodes. You will need to note the data footprint and the cache size when allocating nodes and PEs. 
<ol>
<li> -p 10000, -T 50.  
<li> -p 50000, -T 20. 
</ol>
<li> Horizontal communication <b>[Extra-credit]</b>: <!--But, in the updated tarfile we
have made sure that ceiling of the division of length of one tile in the Horizontal direction and problem size should be equal to -p problem size in order to avoid idle procesors and also to make your communication code easier to write. You can modify the conditional statement in your code to accept different values of -y ysize.-->

Use the same two problem instances as you used for vertical communication for your experimental evaluation.
Here, you will have a choice to explore -x xsize and -y ysize for a given
problem size and number of processors.
</ol>

<h3>Code Submission</h3> Submit your PA4.(1/2).tar containing vertical
communication file (Jacobi2D-BlockParallel-MPI-VERT.test.c).  You may also
include the extra-credit file Jacobi2D-BlockParallel-MPI.test.c.

<h3>Report Submission</h3> Outline
<ol>
<li>Hypothesis
<li>Algorithm Description
<li>Blocking description: include details on ghost cell exchanges.
<li>Experimental Setup 
<li>Results
<li>Conclusions and Analysis (was your hypothesis correct?).
</ol>

<h3>Some Notes on Getting Started</h3> Dowload <a href="PA4.tar">the Starter
code</a>. You can download the <b>simpler
version</b> <a href="PA4_simple.tar"> PA4_simple</a>.  <!--The only modification
that we made is in the piece of code shown above.  Apart from that, the
directory structure has been taken out and replaced with a simple Makefile.
The Jacobi2D-BlockParallel-MPI.perfcompopts in the original file has been
directly incorporated into the simplified Makefile.  It is simply including
the compiler options that you want to explore.  Here we are using only -O3
option.--> <br><br> The provided MPI code is complete for sequential execution.
It also has a validation code.  When you open the tarball attempt to make the
executable by typing the following:
<pre>
make Jacobi2D-BlockParallel-MPI
</pre>
Then attempt to run the code and make sure that it validates for serial
execution (number of processor=1)
<pre>
On Cray (required to run only on Cray)
$ aprun -n1 Jacobi2D-BlockParallel-MPI -p 8 -x 8 -y 8 -v
Time: 0.000019
SUCCESS

On CS machines (can run on CS machines to debug code before transferring files to Cray)
$ mpirun -np 1 Jacobi2D-BlockParallel-MPI -p 8 -x 8 -y 8 -v 
Time:0.000034 
SUCCESS
</pre>
Note the command line arguments. <br> 
p is the problem size.<br>  
x is the length of one tile in the Horizontal direction.<br> 
y is the length of one tile in the Vertical direction.<br> 
v indicates that validation should take place.<br>
Do NOT change the command line argument parsing code (in util.h).<br>
DO NOT run your parallel code with validation flag.<br>
<!--Running experiments with validation on can take significant time (especially for
larger problem size).  So, you can verify certain problem instances and turn
it off when exploring tile size.  Plan your experiments accordingly.<br>->
